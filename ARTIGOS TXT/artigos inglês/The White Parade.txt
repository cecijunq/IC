The White Parade
The White Parade is a 1934 film directed by Irving Cummings and starring Loretta Young and John Boles. It was written by Rian James, Jesse Lasky Jr., Sonya Levien and Ernest Pascal, from the novel by Rian James.
Dedicated to "the memory of Florence Nightingale", the plot concerns the travails and romances of young women as they study to become nurses.  The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.
The only surviving print is located at the UCLA film archive. The print is in rough shape; several frames are out of alignment, at times, while the whole picture looks bleached out and very fuzzy. As well, near the end of the film, a sign pops up indicating "reel 7".
