An enchantress disguised as an old beggar woman arrives at a castle and offers a selfish prince an enchanted rose if he shelters her from the storm. When he scornfully declines, she reveals her true form and transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects. For the curse to be broken, the prince must learn to love someone and earn that person's love before the last petal of the rose falls; otherwise, he will remain a beast forever.
Several years later, in a nearby village, Belle, the bookworm daughter of eccentric inventor Maurice, dreams of adventure while constantly rejecting advances from Gaston, an arrogant hunter. While traveling to present an invention at a fair, Maurice becomes lost in the forest and seeks refuge in the Beast's castle, and is imprisoned for trespassing. After Belle finds Maurice locked in the castle dungeon, she offers to take his place as a prisoner; the Beast agrees.
Belle meets the castle's servants, including candelabra Lumi√®re, mantel clock Cogsworth, teapot Mrs. Potts, and her son Chip, a teacup. When she finds the enchanted rose, the Beast angrily forces her to flee outside. Wolves ambush Belle, and the Beast rescues her, injuring himself. As she nurses his wounds, they develop a rapport.
In the village, Maurice fails to convince the townsfolk of the Beast. Hearing Maurice's statements, Gaston bribes Monsieur D'Arque, the warden of the local insane asylum, to have Maurice declared insane and locked up, which Gaston will use to blackmail Belle into marrying him in exchange for Maurice's release. Before they can act, Maurice leaves to attempt a rescue alone.
Belle discovers Maurice's predicament via a magic mirror. The Beast releases Belle to rescue him. Returning to town, Belle reveals the Beast via the mirror, shocking the townsfolk and proving her father's sanity. Realizing she has fallen for the Beast, Gaston jealously has her thrown into the cellar with Maurice and rallies the villagers to slay the Beast. Chip, who stowed away when Belle left, frees the two with Maurice's wood-chopping machine.
Gaston attacks the depressed Beast, who regains his spirit upon seeing Belle return. He spares Gaston's life, but Gaston fatally stabs him before losing his footing and falling to his demise. Belle tearfully professes her love to a dying Beast as the last petal falls, which undoes the spell, reviving the Beast and restoring him and his servants to their human forms. The prince and Belle later host a ball for the kingdom.
