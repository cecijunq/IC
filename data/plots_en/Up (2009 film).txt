Ten-year old Carl Fredricksen idolizes famed explorer Charles Muntz, who was discredited when a giant bird skeleton he brought back from Paradise Falls in South America is deemed a fake. He travels back to the Falls, vowing to not return until he can bring back a live specimen. Carl befriends Ellie, another fan of Muntz, who keeps a scrapbook of her adventures and dreams of moving her "clubhouse" (an abandoned home) to Paradise Falls. Carl and Ellie eventually marry, move into and renovate the clubhouse, and take jobs at the city zoo as a balloon salesman and tour guide, respectively. After Ellie suffers a miscarriage, the couple decide to save for a trip to Paradise Falls but must repeatedly spend the money on more pressing needs. Years later, Carl decides to surprise Ellie with tickets to Paradise Falls, but she falls ill and is hospitalized. Ellie gives him her scrapbook before she dies.
Now in his late 70s, Carl holds out in his house while the neighborhood around him is redeveloped. After he unintentionally injures a construction worker, the court deems him a public menace and orders his move to an assisted living facility. However, Carl resolves to keep his promise to Ellie and attaches thousands of balloons to his house to fly to Paradise Falls. Russell, a young "Wilderness Explorer" scout attempting to earn his final merit badge, for assisting the elderly, becomes an accidental stowaway. Before Carl can land and send Russell home, a storm propels the house to South America.
The house lands on a tepui opposite Paradise Falls. Carl and Russell harness themselves to the still-buoyant house and begin to tug it across the mesa. Along the way, they encounter a giant flightless bird whom Russell names Kevin (although they later discover it is female) and Dug, a Golden Retriever whose collar has a device that translates his thoughts into human speech. Unable to get rid of them, Carl begrudgingly allows both to join the party.
A pack of dogs, all wearing collar translators, surrounds the group. The dogs' master is revealed to be an elderly Charles Muntz, who invites Carl and Russell aboard his dirigible and talks about his decades-long quest to capture a bird. Carl's initial excitement over meeting his hero fades as he realizes the extent of Muntz's obsession and mental instability. When Russell notes the skeleton’s resemblance to Kevin, Muntz turns hostile, insinuating he has murdered other travelers whom he suspected of seeking the bird for themselves. Carl, Russell, and Dug flee the dirigible, pursued by Muntz’s dogs; they are rescued by Kevin, who is injured in the process. Hearing Kevin call out to her chicks, Carl agrees to take her home, but Muntz captures Kevin and starts a fire beneath the house. Forced to choose, Carl opts to save his home, allowing Muntz to escape with Kevin and losing Russell's respect.
Alone and disheartened, Carl looks through Ellie's scrapbook and discovers that she filled in the blank pages with photos of their life together, noted "Thanks for the adventure - now go have a new one!" Reinvigorated, he goes outside, only to see Russell setting out after Kevin using balloons and a leaf blower. Carl lightens his house by throwing out furniture and keepsakes, enabling it to fly again.
Muntz captures Russell, but Carl and Dug board the dirigible and free both him and Kevin. Muntz pursues them and traps them inside the house. Carl and the others retreat back to the airship just as his tether breaks away. Muntz leaps after them, but snags his leg in balloon strings and falls to his death. The house descends out of sight beneath the clouds.
Carl and Russell reunite Kevin with her chicks before returning home in Muntz's airship. Russell receives his "Assisting the Elderly" badge, and Carl presents Russell with a grape soda bottle cap Ellie gave Carl when they first met, which he dubs "The Ellie Badge." Unbeknownst to Carl, the house lands on the cliff overlooking Paradise Falls, fulfilling his promise to Ellie.
