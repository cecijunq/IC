In 1935 England, 13-year-old Briony Tallis, the youngest daughter of the wealthy Tallis family spies on her older sister, Cecilia, and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner (with whom Briony is infatuated), from her bedroom window.  During Cecilia's and Robbie's argument by the garden fountain, Robbie accidentally breaks a vase and yells at Cecilia to stay where she is to avoid cutting her feet. Still angered, Cecilia strips off her outer clothing and climbs into the fountain to retrieve one of the glass pieces. Briony observes from the window and misinterprets the relationship between Cecilia and Robbie.
Robbie drafts a note to Cecilia to apologise for the incident. In one draft, he pens his unfiltered feelings of attraction for her in explicit language.  Although he never intends for anyone to see this version of the note, he mistakenly places it (instead of the second more formal note he drafts) in an envelope which he asks Briony to deliver to Cecilia. Briony reads the letter before giving it to her sister. Later, she describes the note to her 15-year-old cousin, Lola, who calls Robbie a "sex maniac". 
Paul Marshall, a visiting friend of Briony's older brother Leon, introduces himself to the visiting cousins and appears to be attracted to Lola. Before dinner, Robbie and Cecilia are alone in the library, at which time he apologises for the obscene letter, but she confesses her love for him. They make love against the wall in the library as Briony walks in unseen, sees them, and mistakenly thinks her sister is being raped.
During dinner, Lola's twin brothers go missing, and the household organises into search parties. While participating in the search, Briony comes across Lola being raped by a man who flees. Despite never seeing the man clearly, Briony is convinced that it was Robbie; a confused Lola who did not see his face does not dissent. Later, Robbie — who finds the twins unharmed — returns to the house.  He  is arrested despite Cecilia's pleas of his innocence. Lola and Briony's testimony, along with her turning over the explicit letter, convinces everyone but Cecilia of his guilt.
Four years later, during the Second World War, Robbie is released from prison on the condition that he joins the army and fights in the Battle of France. Separated from his unit, he makes his way on foot to Dunkirk. He thinks back to six months earlier when he met Cecilia, now a nurse. Briony, now 18, joined Cecilia's old nursing unit at St Thomas' Hospital in London rather than go to the University of Cambridge. She writes to her sister, but Cecilia cannot forgive her for her part in Robbie's arrest and conviction. Robbie, who is gravely ill from an infected wound and hallucinating, arrives at the beaches of Dunkirk, where he awaits evacuation.
Later, Briony, who regrets implicating Robbie, learns that Paul Marshall is about to marry Lola. As Briony attends the wedding, it sinks in that Paul assaulted Lola during the search for the twins years ago. Briony visits Cecilia to apologise and suggests correcting her testimony, to which Cecilia says she would be an "unreliable witness". Briony is surprised to find Robbie there living with her sister while in London on leave. Briony apologises for her deceit, but Robbie is enraged that she has not accepted responsibility for her actions. Cecilia calms him down, and Robbie instructs Briony how to set the record straight and get his conviction overturned. Briony agrees. Cecilia adds that Briony include what she remembers of Danny Hardman, but Briony points out that Paul Marshall was the rapist and Cecilia adds he has just married Lola and now Lola will not be able to testify against her husband.
Decades later, when Briony is an elderly and successful novelist, she gives an interview about her latest and last book, an autobiographical novel titled Atonement, and explains that she is dying from vascular dementia. The audience learns that the portion of the book where Robbie and Cecilia are living together and Briony attempts to apologize to them is fictitious. The reality is that she could never atone for her mistake, and Cecilia and Robbie never reunited; Robbie died of septicaemia from his infected wound at Dunkirk, and Cecilia drowned months later during an underground flood due to the Balham tube station bombing during the Blitz. Briony admits that she wrote her novel with its fictitious ending to give the two, in fiction, the happiness they never had because she was responsible for mistakenly identifying Robbie as Lola's rapist. The last scene shows an imagined and happily reunited Cecilia and Robbie staying in the house by the sea which they had intended to visit once they were reunited.
