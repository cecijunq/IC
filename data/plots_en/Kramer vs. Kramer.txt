Ted Kramer, a workaholic advertising executive in New York City, has just landed an important account and job promotion. However, when he shares the news with Joanna, his wife of eight years, she shocks him by announcing she is leaving him. She also leaves their seven-year-old son Billy, claiming she is an unfit mother. Ted begins a life struggling to balance his demanding job with being an attentive single parent. Ted confides in Joanna’s best friend, Margaret Phelps, and the two become close as they each navigate through their respective post-divorce adjustments. 
Fifteen months after Joanna leaves, she meets Ted at a restaurant, asking for custody of Billy. Ted angrily refuses, prompting Joanna to file suit for custody. While the suit is pending, Ted is fired after missing an important deadline followed by additional instances of poor performance, all due to prioritizing his parenting responsibilities. Ted accepts another advertising job making less salary in order not to be unemployed at the custody trial.  
At trial, Ted defends his parenting despite testimony about his troubled employment and the revelation that Billy sustained an injury while in Ted’s care. Custody is  awarded to Joanna, and Ted declines to appeal in order to protect Billy. 
During the custody exchange to Joanna, she tells Ted, outside Billy’s presence, that Billy has been home all along with Ted and he should remain there.
