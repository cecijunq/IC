Chicago vascular surgeon Dr. Richard Kimble returns home to discover that his wife, Helen, was murdered by a one-armed assailant who evades capture. Helen's substantial life insurance policy and a misinterpreted 911 call result in Kimble's arrest. Falsely accused of murder, he is convicted and receives a death sentence.
During transport to death row, Kimble's fellow prisoners attempt an escape,  sending the bus down a ravine and into the path of an oncoming train. Kimble saves a corrections officer and flees. Ninety minutes later, Deputy US Marshal Samuel Gerard and his staff arrive at the derailment scene and launch a manhunt. Kimble sneaks into a hospital to treat his wounds and acquire clothing. After altering his appearance, he steals an ambulance and evades most of the marshals in a tunnel by entering a storm drain. Gerard follows and loses a gun. Kimble finds it and proclaims his innocence, pointing the gun at Gerard, who replies that he does not care. Spare gun in hand, he corners Kimble over a high spillway, but Kimble jumps and escapes.
Seeking to clear his name, he returns to Chicago to search for the real murderer. He rents an apartment and acquires money from his friend and colleague Dr. Charles Nichols. Kimble infiltrates the prosthetic department at Cook County Hospital to make a list of patients who would need a prosthetic arm. 
Gerard deduces what Kimble is doing and spots him at Chicago City Hall after interviewing a jailed suspect. Following their subsequent chase, Kimble disappears into Chicago's St. Patrick's Day parade. Later, he breaks into the home of another suspect on his list, Frederick Sykes, and discovers a photo that confirms Sykes as the murderer. Sykes, a former cop, now works security for Devlin-MacGregor, a pharmaceutical company that is releasing a drug called Provasic. Kimble had investigated the drug and found that it causes liver damage, which would have prevented FDA approval. Kimble calls Gerard while in Sykes' home, ensuring that the call is traced, then flees, leaving open evidence. With this lead, Gerard conducts his own investigation, now suspicious of Sykes. 
As Kimble investigates samples at his former hospital, Chicago Memorial Hospital, he figures out that Dr. Nichols, a board member of Devlin-MacGregor, covered up Provasic's side effects to get it approved. He ordered Sykes to murder Kimble in a staged burglary that went wrong, resulting in Helen's death, and presumably had Sykes murder Dr. Alec Lentz, another developer who discovered Provasic's risks. En route to a hotel conference where Nichols is presenting Provasic, Kimble is attacked by Sykes on a train. Sykes murders a transit cop who interrupts their struggle but is overpowered by Kimble.
Kimble publicly confronts Nichols at the conference, accusing him of falsifying Provasic's side-effects and planning the murders. This leads to a fight that spills onto the roof. Chicago Police issue a shoot-to-kill order for Kimble since the transit police officer's death is assumed to be his fault. However, Gerard stops a police helicopter from sniping Kimble. He calls out to Kimble, informing him of the conspiracy and his belief in Kimble's innocence. Nichols knocks out Marshal Renfro, taking his gun, and as he readies to shoot Gerard, Kimble saves him by attacking Nichols with a pipe.
Kimble surrenders, and Sykes and Nichols are arrested. Kimble is escorted out of the hotel as the press questions the police about the newfound suspects. Gerard uncuffs Kimble in the back of a squad car. They are driven away, and Kimble is assured he will be exonerated.
