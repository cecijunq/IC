26-year-old Chris Washington, a black photographer, travels to upstate New York for a weekend getaway to meet the family of his white girlfriend, Rose Armitage. He has uncomfortable conversations with her parents, Dean, a neurosurgeon, and Missy, a psychiatrist. Her brother Jeremy arrives and tells embarrassing stories about his sister at dinner. Chris witnesses eerie behavior from the family's black servants, Georgina and Walter.
Missy tricks Chris into a hypnotherapy session, using the noise of a spoon stirring a teacup as a hypnotic trigger, to cure his smoking addiction. While in a trance, he confesses that his mother was killed in a hit-and-run when he was a child and he feels responsible as he waited too long to call for help. At Missy's prompting, he falls into a dark void she calls the "sunken place", where no one can hear him. The next morning, he no longer feels a desire to smoke.
Dozens of wealthy white people arrive for the Armitage's annual get-together; Chris feels uncomfortable with their remarks about him. He meets a blind art dealer, Jim Hudson, who takes interest in Chris's photography, and another black man, Logan King, whom he finds familiar. Like Walter and Georgina, Logan behaves oddly, and is married to a white woman thirty years his senior. Chris tries to photograph Logan; when the camera flash goes off, Logan becomes hysterical, rushing at Chris and frantically shouting at him to "get out".
The party guests hold a silent auction. Hudson makes the winning bid, with Chris as the "prize". Chris sends the photo of Logan to his friend, the TSA officer Rod Williams, who recognizes him as Andre Hayworth, a missing man from Brooklyn. Suspecting a conspiracy, Rod tries to tell the police, but they laugh him off due to his fixation on sex trafficking. Chris finds photos of Rose in prior relationships with numerous black partners, including Walter and Georgina, contradicting her claim that he is the first black person she has dated. He tries to leave, but Rose withholds the car keys. Jeremy blocks the door and Missy uses the hypnotic trigger to send Chris back to the sunken place.
Chris awakens strapped to an armchair in the basement. In a video presentation, Rose's grandfather, Roman, explains that the family transplants wealthy white people's brains into others' bodies, granting them preferred physical characteristics. The host's consciousness remains powerless in the sunken place. Hudson does not care about Chris's race, and only wants his eyesight. 
Missy attempts to hypnotize Chris again, but he blocks the hypnotic trigger by plugging his ears with cotton stuffing pulled from the armchair. He bludgeons Jeremy, kills Dean and Missy, and kills Jeremy when he attacks. Chris attempts to escape in Jeremy's Porsche but accidentally hits Georgina, who is possessed by Rose's grandmother Marianne. Compelled by guilt from his mother's death, he retrieves her. She attacks him, causing the car to crash and kill her.
Rose and Walter, who is possessed by Roman, arrive to apprehend Chris. He uses the flash on his phone to incapacitate Roman. Walter temporarily regains control of his body and takes Rose's rifle and shoots her and then himself. Rod arrives in a TSA car and picks up Chris, leaving Rose bleeding on the road.
