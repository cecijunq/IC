Wounded from a gunshot, insurance salesman Walter Neff stumbles into his Los Angeles office. He records a dictaphone confession for claims manager Barton Keyes. 
A year earlier, Neff flirts with Phyllis Dietrichson during a house call about her husband's automobile insurance. Phyllis asks about getting a policy on her husband's life without his knowledge. Neff deduces she is contemplating murder and wants no part of it. Phyllis visits Neff's apartment. He concocts a plan to murder Mr. Dietrichson and trigger the "double indemnity" clause, increasing the payout.
Neff hides in the back seat of Dietrichson's car while Phyllis drives her husband to a train station. Neff breaks his neck and boards the train posing as Dietrichson. At a prearranged spot, he jumps off the train. Phyllis helps pose Dietrichson's body on the tracks. 
The president of Neff's insurance company believes the death was suicide. Keyes scoffs at the idea, but he does find it strange Dietrichson did not file a claim after breaking his leg. He grows to suspect Phyllis. He deduces she had an accomplice who will split the insurance money. The company refuses to pay out the accidental death clause because Dietrichson was unaware of the policy.
Dietrichson's daughter Lola befriends Neff. She thinks her stepmother Phyllis killed her father and his first wife. Neff fears Phyllis will murder her since Dietrichson changed his will in Lola's favor.
Keyes finds a witness who says the man on the train was not Dietrichson. Neff warns Phyllis that pursuing the insurance claim in court risks exposing the murder. He urges Phyllis to lie low while he convinces his boss to pay out the claim. Neff learns that Lola's hotheaded boyfriend Nino has been visiting Phyllis every night since the murder. Trying to prevent Lola's death, Neff confronts Phyllis.
Neff tells Phyllis he knows about her and Nino. He figures her plan was to manipulate Nino into murdering Lola and maybe him. He threatens to kill Phyllis and blame Nino. Phyllis shoots him. He dares her to shoot again. She does not, and he takes her gun. She says she never loved him "until a minute ago, when I couldn't fire that second shot." As they embrace, Neff shoots her twice.
Nino comes to the house. Neff warns him not to go inside. Neff drives to his office and starts recording his confession. Keyes arrives and hears the truth. Neff plans to flee to Mexico but collapses before he can leave the building.
