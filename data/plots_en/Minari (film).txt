Minari (film)
In 1983, the Korean immigrant Yi family moves from California to a new plot of land in rural Arkansas, where father Jacob hopes to grow Korean produce to sell to vendors in Dallas. One of his first decisions is to decline the services of a water diviner; he digs a well in a spot he finds himself. He enlists the help of Paul, an eccentric local man and Korean War veteran. Jacob is optimistic about the life ahead, but his wife, Monica, is disappointed and worries about their son David's heart condition; he is frequently told not to run due to this. Jacob and Monica work sexing chicks at the nearby hatchery and argue constantly while David and his sister, Anne, eavesdrop.
To help watch the children during the day, they arrange for Monica's mother, Soon-ja, to travel from South Korea. Forced to share a room with her, David avoids her because she does not fit his idea of a grandmother. Still, Soon-ja attempts to adjust to life in Arkansas and bond with the children. The well Jacob dug runs dry. He is reluctant to pay for county water, but eventually is forced to do so. He runs into additional difficulties, such as the vendor in Dallas canceling their order at the last minute, but perseveres despite Monica's desire to return to California. This brings their marriage closer to a breaking point.
Meanwhile, Soon-ja takes David to plant minari seeds by the creek. She tells him how resilient and useful the plant is, and predicts plentiful growth. David finally begins to warm to her after she teaches him hwatu, bandages his wounds, and soothes him to sleep. Soon-ja also encourages him to do more physical activity, something his parents discourage, but she says he is stronger than they think. Soon-ja suddenly suffers a stroke overnight. She survives with medical treatment, but is left with impaired movement and speech.
Jacob, Monica, Anne, and David head to Oklahoma City for David's heart appointment and to meet a vendor for Jacob's produce. Although they learn that David's heart condition has dramatically improved and Jacob makes a deal to sell vegetables to a Korean grocer, Jacob also indirectly admits to Monica that his crops' success is more important to him than their family's stability. After an emotional argument, the two agree to separate.
During their absence, Soon-ja accidentally sets the barn containing the produce on fire. Upon arriving home, Jacob rushes in to save the crops, and Monica soon follows. But the fire grows out of control, and they decide to save each other, leaving the barn to burn. Distraught and confused, Soon-ja wanders off. Anne and David call for her to come back. Seeing that she is not responding to them, David breaks into a sprint to meet her, blocking her path. Soon-ja seems to recognize David for a moment and reaches for his hand. Her grandchildren lead her back home. The family is asleep on the floor, collapsed from fatigue. Soon-ja watches them sleep with a subdued expression.
Some time later, Jacob and Monica are with the water diviner, who finds a spot for a well. They mark it with a stone signifying their intention to stay on the farm. Jacob and David then head to the creek to harvest the minari, which has grown successfully, with Jacob noting how good a spot Soon-ja picked to plant it.
