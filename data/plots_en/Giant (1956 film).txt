In the mid-1920s, wealthy Texas rancher Jordan "Bick" Benedict Jr. (Rock Hudson) travels to Maryland on a horse-buying trip. He meets socialite Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), and they marry and return to the Benedicts' Texas cattle ranch, Reata. Bick's older sister, Luz, runs the household and resents Leslie's intrusion. Leslie learns that she is expected to be subservient in the male-dominated Texas culture and that Hispanics are viewed as inferior to whites. Jett Rink, a ranch hand, becomes infatuated with her. When Jett drives her around the ranch, Leslie observes the Hispanic workers' terrible living conditions. She presses Bick to improve their situation and oversees the treatment of the infant son of Bick's ranch hand Angel Obregon, Angel, Jr.. Bick, however, is not receptive to his family doctor treating Hispanics. 
Luz is killed while riding Leslie's horse, War Winds. Her will leaves a small piece of Benedict land to Jett. Bick, who despises Jett, offers to buy the property, but Jett refuses and names his land "Little Reata".
Leslie and Bick have twins, Jordan III ("Jordy") and Judy, and later another daughter, Luz II. The marriage becomes strained, and Leslie takes the children to her parents for an extended visit. Bick follows her to Maryland, and he and Leslie reconcile and return to Texas.
Jett continues working his land, striking oil. He flaunts his newfound fortune and tries to persuade Bick to let him drill for oil on Reata. Bick, determined to preserve his family's cattle ranching legacy, refuses.
Years later, in 1941, tensions arise regarding the now-grown Benedict children. Bick intends that Jordy will succeed him and run the ranch, but Jordy wants to become a doctor. Leslie plans for Judy to attend finishing school in Switzerland, but she wants to study animal husbandry at Texas Tech. Each sibling convinces one parent to persuade the other to allow them to pursue their own goals.
At the family Christmas party, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Bick offers Judy's new husband, Bob Dace, the opportunity to work on the ranch after the war ends. Dace declines, wanting to build his own life with Judy. Realizing that his children will not take over the ranch when he retires, Bick accepts Jett's offer to allow drilling on Reata. The Benedicts grow wealthier and more powerful. The war ends with Bob's safe return, but Angel Obregon, Jr., is killed in action. Jordy marries Juana, the daughter of the ranch's Hispanic doctor who treated Angel as a baby.
At his Austin hotel, Jett hosts a huge party in his own honor and invites the Benedicts. Jett and Luz II have developed a flirtatious relationship that ends after Luz rejects Jett's awkward proposal. Jett becomes drunk and prohibits his staff from serving Hispanics; consequently, Juana is ignored at the hotel beauty shop. Enraged, Jordy starts and loses a fight with Jett, who then has him thrown out. Bick challenges Jett but, seeing that the drunken Jett is in no state to defend himself, he and the other Benedicts leave. Jett passes out as he attempts to give his speech in front of the packed ballroom. Later, Luz II hears him bemoaning his unrequited love for Leslie and leaves heartbroken.
Driving home the next day, the Benedicts stop at a diner. Sarge, the owner, insults Juana and her and Jordy's young son with a racial slur. When Sarge tries to eject a Hispanic family from the diner, Bick intervenes and a fight ensues. Bick refuses to quit in spite of a terrific beating; finally he is knocked cold. Back at Reata, he laments failing to preserve the Benedict family legacy. Leslie replies that, after the diner fight, he was her hero for the first time and she considers their family legacy a success. They look at their two grandsons, one white and one Hispanic.
