Karen Blixen recalls living in Africa, where she moved in 1913 as a wealthy Dane, about to marry.
After being spurned by a Swedish nobleman, she proposes a marriage of convenience to his brother, Baron Bror Blixen. They prepare to move to Nairobi, British East Africa, where Bror is to set up a dairy ranch with Karen's money. She will join him a few months later, at which time they will marry. En route to Nairobi, Karen's train is hailed by a big-game hunter named Denys Finch Hatton, who knows Bror and entrusts her with his ivory haul.
Farah, the Somali headman Bror hired, greets Karen at the railway station. She is taken to the Muthaiga Club. She enters the men-only salon seeking her husband but is asked to leave. Karen and Bror immediately marry, and she becomes Baroness Blixen.
Karen learns that Bror has changed their plan and instead bought a coffee farm, but it is at too high an elevation to be very productive. Karen needs Bror's help managing the farm, but he is more interested in guiding big-game hunting safaris.
Karen comes to love Africa and its people. She looks after the Kikuyu people who are squatting on her land, establishes a school for them, helps with their medical needs, and arbitrates their disputes. Meanwhile, she attempts to build a formal European homelife equal to other nearby upper-class colonists. She befriends a young woman, Felicity (whose character is based on a young Beryl Markham). Eventually, Karen and Bror's mutual feelings deepen and they consummate their marriage. However, Bror continues pursuing other women. To fill her evenings, Karen makes up imaginative stories to entertain visitors.
As WWI reaches East Africa, the colonists form a militia led by colonial patriarch Lord Delamere, and which includes Denys and Bror. A military expedition searches for forces from the neighboring German colony of German East Africa. Responding to the militia's need for supplies, Karen leads a difficult expedition to find them and returns safely. 
When Karen contracts syphilis from Bror, she returns to Denmark for treatment and recuperation while Bror manages the farm in her absence. When Karen returns, Bror resumes his safari work. They live separately after she discovers he is still a philanderer. Later, Karen and Denys share an ambivalent kiss at a New Year's party. 
The relationship between Karen and Denys develops, and he comes to live with her. Denys acquires a Gipsy Moth biplane and often takes Karen flying. Karen and Bror divorce when Bror wants to marry another woman. Karen wants her and Denys to solidify their relationship, though he prefers his autonomy. When Karen learns Denys is taking Felicity on a private safari, she confronts him about his refusing a monogamous relationship. He assures Karen he only wants her but feels marriage is immaterial. This eventually drives them apart and, refusing to meet Karen's ultimatum not to take Felicity flying, he moves out.
The farm eventually yields a good harvest, but a fire destroys it and the factory, forcing Karen to sell out. Before leaving Kenya for Denmark, she appeals to the incoming governor to provide land for her Kikuyu workers and sells most of her remaining possessions at a rummage sale. Denys visits the now-empty house. He says he no longer feels comfortable being alone and that his feelings for her have changed. He asks to join her on her journey back to Mombasa.
Denys departs for a safari scouting trip in his airplane but will fly Karen to Mombasa when he returns; Karen will then continue on to Denmark. Shortly after, Bror arrives to tell Karen that Denys' biplane crashed in Tsavo. During Denys' funeral, Karen recites an excerpt from an A. E. Housman poem about a lauded athlete who, like Denys, died young and was not fated to decline into old age. Before departing, Karen goes to the Muthaiga Club to arrange forwarding her mail. The members, having come to admire her, invite her into the men-only salon for a toast. At the railway station, she gives Farah the compass that Denys had given to her and asks him to say her name, so she can hear his voice one last time. Sometime later, Farah writes to Karen in Denmark, telling her that a pair of lions often visit Denys' grave.
The ending on-screen narrative notes that Karen became an author under the pen name, Isak Dinesen. Works include her memoir about Africa, Out of Africa. The film opened with its first line. Karen never returned to Africa.
