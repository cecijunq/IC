New York prize fighter Terry Malloy's career was cut short when he purposely lost a fight at the request of mob boss Johnny Friendly. Terry now works for Friendly's labor union as a longshoreman while his older, more educated brother Charley is Friendly's right-hand man. Terry is coerced into luring fellow worker Joey Doyle onto a rooftop, where he believes Friendly's henchmen want to talk Joey out of testifying to the Waterfront Crime Commission. When they instead murder Joey by throwing him off the roof, Terry confronts Friendly, but is threatened and bribed into acquiescence.
Joey's sister Edie shames priest Father Barry into calling the dockworkers to a meeting, where he tries unsuccessfully to persuade them to stand together. Terry attends as a snitch for Friendly, but when the meeting is violently broken up by Friendly's men, he helps Edie escape, missing Father Barry convincing one worker to testify. Friendly and Charley are angry at Terry's involvement with Edie and for not informing them of the testimony. The worker who testified is killed in a staged workplace accident.
Father Barry makes a speech comparing the murders to Christ's crucifixion. Terry's unwillingness to testify lessens with his growing feelings for Edie and her pursuit of justice. He confesses his role in Joey's death to Father Barry and later to Edie, who runs from him.
Friendly sends Charley with a job offer to keep Terry quiet. Knowing Friendly will have Terry killed if he refuses, Charley tries to persuade his brother, eventually threatening him with a gun. Terry waves him away and expresses regret about throwing his best fight, blaming Charley for setting up the fix. Charley gives Terry the gun and tells him to run. Terry finds Edie and they kiss. Hearing Terry's name called, they run out and find Charley's body hung in the alley.
Terry goes to a bar to shoot Friendly, but Father Barry persuades him to instead testify in court. Following Terry's damning testimony Friendly is cut off from his powerful friends and facing indictment. Friendly bars Terry from union jobs. At the dock everyone is called to work except Terry, who taunts Friendly, shouting that he is proud to have testified.
Friendly goads Terry into attacking him. He calls for his thugs, who severely beat Terry. The longshoremen refuse to work unless Terry is also allowed to work. Father Barry tells Terry that he lost the battle but can win the war if he can walk into the warehouse. Terry stumbles to the warehouse, where the boss nods to Terry and tells them to get to work. The men follow Terry inside, ignoring Friendly as he berates them. The door closes, leaving Friendly outside.
