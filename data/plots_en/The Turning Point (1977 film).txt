DeeDee Rodgers leaves an eminent New York ballet company after becoming pregnant by Wayne, another dancer in the company. They marry and later move to Oklahoma City to run a dance studio. Emma Jacklin stays with the company and eventually becomes a prima ballerina and well-known figure in the ballet community.
While the company is on tour and performs a show in Oklahoma City, DeeDee and the family go to see the show and then have an after-party for the company at their home. The reunion stirs up old memories and sets the plot into motion.
At the party, DeeDee's daughter Emilia, an aspiring dancer who is also Emma's goddaughter, is invited to take class with the company the following day. Afterwards, Emilia is asked to join the company but she does not immediately accept the offer as she wants to think it over. DeeDee and Wayne decide that DeeDee should go to New York with Emilia, who is rather shy and does not make friends as easily as her younger sister. Meanwhile, their son, Ethan, gets a scholarship to the company's summer program while Wayne and their other daughter stay in Oklahoma City.
Once in New York, they rent several rooms in Carnegie Hall with Madame Dakharova, a ballet coach. Emilia soon starts a relationship with a Russian dancer in the company, Yuri. However, when she catches Yuri with another dancer, Caroline, the broken-hearted Emilia gets drunk in a bar before a performance, and Emma takes the situation at hand and cares for and helps Emilia complete the performance. This angers DeeDe who, because of a brief affair with the former conductor of the company, has causeed conflict between herself and Emilia. Meanwhile, Emma argues with Arnold, the choreographer, about giving her a better role in his new ballet, which he refuses and leads Emma to suggest Emilia for the role instead. DeeDee resents that Emma dotes on Emilia; after all, DeeDee chose family life over her career while Emma chose not to have children and to excel as a ballerina. DeeDee accuses Emma of telling her to get pregnant and have Wayne's baby so Emma could play the lead in Anna Karenina'.
Eventually, Emma and DeeDee get into a physical altercation on the rooftop of Carnegie Hall before finally settling their misunderstandings; DeeDee admits her jealousy of Emma's life, and Emma admits that she would have "done anything" to get the lead in "Anna Karenina." 
Because of her stunning performance in Arnold's ballent, Emilia is given the lead in "Sleeping Beauty" alongside former love Yuri, and she and Yuri make up and agree to a professional partnership and nothing more. Deedee decides she is content with her life and the decision she made to leave professional ballet to have a family. Emma accepts that her performing days are numbered, and she must embrace a different role within the company. DeeDee and Emma step onto the stage and reminisce together.
