In the film, Herbert Marshall appears as W. Somerset Maugham, the story's narrator and an important character who drifts in and out of the lives of the other major players. The opening scene is at a party in the summer of 1919 at a Chicago country club. Elliott Templeton, an expatriate who has been living in France, has returned to the United States to visit his sister, Louisa Bradley, and his niece, Isabel. Isabel is engaged to marry Larry Darrell, recently returned from service as a pilot during the Great War. Elliott disapproves of Larry because he has no money and no interest in getting a job with a future so he can support Isabel properly. Among the party guests are Larry's childhood friend Sophie Nelson and her boyfriend, Bob MacDonald.
Larry refuses a job offer from the father of his friend Gray Maturin, a millionaire who is also in love with Isabel. He tells her that he wants to "loaf" on his small inheritance of $3,000 a year. Larry has been traumatized by the death of a comrade who sacrificed himself to save Larry and is driven to find out what meaning life has. Larry and Isabel agree to postpone their marriage for a year so that he can go to Paris to try to clear his muddled thoughts.
In Paris, Larry immerses himself in the life of a student. After a year, Isabel and her mother come to Paris. Larry asks Isabel to marry him, but she cannot bear to live in poverty and breaks their engagement. At the reception after Isabel's marriage to Gray, which will provide her with the elite social and family life she craves, Sophie and Bob MacDonald are there. They have a baby named Linda. Meanwhile, Larry works in a coal mine in France, where a drunk, debauched defrocked priest, Kosti, urges him travel to India to learn from a mystic. Larry studies at a monastery in the Himalayas under the tutelage of a holy man, experiencing a moment of elightenment on a mountaintop. The holy man urges Larry to go back to his people but to not lose his awareness of the infinite beauty of the world and of God. Meanwhile, in the States, Bob and the baby die in a car crash.
Back in Paris, Maugham meets Elliott by chance and learns that Isabel and her family are living with Elliott after being financially ruined by the stock market crash of 1929. Elliott "sold short" before the crash and "made a killing" in the market. Maugham arranges a lunch for Elliott and his household to meet an old friend, who turns out to be Larry.
Later, while slumming at a disreputable bar in the Rue de Lappe, they encounter Sophie, now a drunkard and drug user, and her abusive pimp. Larry, who did not know about the tragedy, asks what happened, and Isabel and Gray tell him. Isabel says they had to "drop" Sophie because of her bad behavior and insists there was always something wrong with her or she would not have been so weak. Larry starts seeing Sophie and tells Isabel that they are engaged. The news drives her wild, but she doesnâ€™t want to lose Larry and invites them all to lunch the next day at the Ritz.
After lunch, they have coffee in the lobby. The waiter convinces Elliott that a little Persovka can do no harm, and Isabel asks for some to be sent to the apartment. She wants to give Sophie a wedding dress and arranges to meet at the apartment the next afternoon. After the fitting, Isabel and Sophie talk. Sophie has not had alcohol since that night in the Rue de Lappe and realizes that this is her last chance. Isabel shows Sophie pictures of her children, which stirs memories of Linda, then leaves to get her daughter. The butler removes the drinks tray; Isabel stares at the bottle of Persovka on the side table and walks out. After a while, Sophie takes multiple drinks.
Larry scours the bars and dives, following the trail of a woman demanding Persovka, until he tracks Sophie to an opium den. She runs away, screaming, and disappears. A year later, she is murdered in Toulon, and her death reunites Larry and Maugham during the police investigation.
Maugham and Larry visit Elliott on his deathbed in Nice, where he tells Gray that he will now have enough money to pay his father's debts and rebuild the business. Immediately after Elliott's death, Isabel learns that Larry is leaving that night. He plans to work his way back to America aboard a tramp steamer. She tells him she loves him and knows he feels the same. Larry asks about Sophie, and Isabel admits to tempting her deliberately, claiming that she did it to save Larry and as a test of Sophie's strength. He says he has the feeling that Sophie is where she wanted to be, with her husband and child.
Isabel tells Maugham that she has lost Larry and still does not understand what he wants. Maugham tells her that Larry has found what most people want and never get. "I don't think anyone can fail to be better and nobler, kinder for knowing him. You see, my dear, goodness is after all the greatest force in the world, and he's got it." Larry, on the deck of a storm-tossed ship, hoists cargo in the rain.
