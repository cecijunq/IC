One September morning, a Soviet Navy submarine called Sprut  draws too close to the New England coast when its captain wants to see North America and runs aground on a sandbar near Gloucester Island, off the New England coast, with a population of about 200 people. Rather than radio for help and risk an embarrassing international incident, the captain sends a nine-man landing party, headed by his zampolit Lieutenant Yuri Rozanov, to find a motor launch to help free the submarine. The men arrive at the house of Walt Whittaker, a vacationing playwright from New York City. Whittaker is eager to get his wife Elspeth and two children, 9+1‚ÅÑ2-year-old Pete and 3-year-old Annie, off the island now that summer is over.
Pete tells his disbelieving dad that nine armed Russians are near the house, but Walt is soon met by Rozanov and one of his men, Alexei Kolchin, who identify themselves as strangers on the island and ask if there are any boats available. Walt is skeptical and asks if they are armed Russians. This startles Rozanov into admitting that they are Russians, and pulling a gun on Walt. Rozanov promises no harm to the Whittakers if they hand over their station wagon. Elspeth provides the car keys, but before the Russians depart, Rozanov orders Alexei to prevent the Whittakers from fleeing. 
The Whittakers' station wagon quickly runs out of gasoline, forcing the Russians to walk. They steal an old sedan from Muriel Everett, the postmistress; she calls Alice Foss, the gossipy telephone switchboard operator, and soon, wild rumors about Russian parachutists and an air assault on the airport throw the island into confusion. Police Chief Link Mattocks and his assistant Norman Jonas try to squelch a citizens' militia led by Fendall Hawkins.
Meanwhile, Walt, accompanied by Elspeth and Pete, overpowers Alexei when Alison Palmer, an 18-year-old neighbor who works as Annie's babysitter, arrives for work that day and gives Walt an opening. Alexei flees during the commotion, but when Walt, Elspeth, and Pete leave to find help, he returns to retrieve his weapon from the house, where only Alison and Annie remain. Despite wanting no fighting, Alexei must obey his superiors in guarding the residence. He promises not to harm anyone and offers to surrender his gun as proof. Alison says that she trusts him and does not want his firearm.
Trying to find the Russians himself, Walt is recaptured by them in the telephone central office. After subduing Mrs. Foss, tying Walt and her together, and disabling the island's telephone switchboard, seven Russians appropriate civilian clothes from a dry cleaner's, steal a cabin cruiser, and head to the submarine. Back at the Whittaker house, Alexei and Alison have talked, kissed and fallen in love. At the phone exchange, Walt and Mrs. Foss hop outside the office. They are eventually discovered by Elspeth and Pete, who untie them. They return to their house, and Walt shoots at and almost kills Rozanov, who reached there just ahead of them. With the misunderstandings cleared up, the Whittakers, Rozanov, and Alexei decide to head into town together to explain to everyone what is happening.
As the tide rises, the sub floats off the sandbar, and it proceeds on the surface to the island's main harbor. Chief Mattocks, having investigated and debunked the rumor of an aerial assault, arrives back in town with the civilian militia. With Rozanov acting as translator, the Russian captain threatens to open fire on the town unless the seven missing sailors are returned to him; his crew faces upwards of 100 armed townspeople. As the situation nears the breaking point, two small boys climb up to the church steeple to see better and one slips and falls, but his belt catches on a gutter, leaving him hanging 40 feet in the air. The American islanders and the Russian submariners unite to form a human pyramid and rescue the boy.
Peace is established between the two parties. However, Hawkins contacted the Air Force by radio. In a joint decision, the submarine leaves the harbor with villagers in boats protecting it. Alexei says goodbye to Alison, the stolen boat with the missing Russian sailors meets the sub, which they board, before two Air Force jets arrive. The jets, however, break off after seeing the escorting flotilla of small craft. To the cheers of the islanders, the Octopus is free to proceed to deep water and safety.
