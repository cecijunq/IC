Chinatown (1974 film)
In 1937, a woman identifying herself as "Evelyn Mulwray" hires private investigator J. J. "Jake" Gittes to trail her husband Hollis, whom she suspects of infidelity. Hollis is chief engineer at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and refuses to build a new dam on the grounds of safety.
Gittes photographs Hollis in the company of a young woman, and the pictures make their way into the Los Angeles Times paper. He is confronted by the real Evelyn Mulwray, who threatens to sue him. Her imposter used him to discredit Hollis. The next day, Gittes investigates a reservoir and finds his police associate, Lieutenant Lou Escobar; Hollis' body has been found there, where he is presumed to have drowned.
Now working for Evelyn, Gittes investigates Hollis' death as a homicide. Meanwhile, although there is a drought, huge quantities of water are released from the reservoir every night. Gittes is warned off by Water Department Security Chief Claude Mulvihill and is attacked by his henchman. The next morning, Gittes receives a call from Ida Sessions, the fake Evelyn Mulwray. She refuses to say who hired her but tells Gittes to check that day's obituaries.
Gittes learns that Hollis was once the business partner of Evelyn's wealthy father, Noah Cross. Cross offers to double Gittes' fee if he searches for Hollis' missing mistress. Gittes discovers that much of the Northwest Valley has recently changed ownership. He visits an orange grove in the valley but is attacked by landowners who believe him to be an agent of the Water Department, which is sabotaging the water supply to force them out.
The Water Department is drying up the land so it can be bought cheaply, and Hollis was murdered when he uncovered the plan. Some of the property in the valley was seemingly purchased by a recently deceased retirement home resident. Gittes and Evelyn bluff their way into the home and confirm that other real estate deals were transacted in the names of unknowing residents, with one of the residents being listed in the previous day's obituary. Their visit is interrupted by the suspicious director, who calls Mulvihill.
After escaping Mulvihill and his thugs, Evelyn and Gittes hide out at her house, where they sleep together. Gittes reveals that, during his days as a police officer in Chinatown, he once tried to protect a woman he loved from being hurt and ended up making sure she was hurt. During the night, Evelyn receives a phone call that makes her leave. Gittes follows her to a house and sees her comforting Mulwray's mistress. A furious Gittes accuses Evelyn of holding the woman hostage, but she claims the woman is her sister, Katherine.
The next day, an anonymous call draws Gittes to Ida's apartment, where he finds her body. Escobar, who is waiting there, says saltwater was found in Hollis' lungs, indicating that he did not drown in the freshwater reservoir. Escobar suspects that Evelyn murdered him and tells Gittes to produce her quickly. At the Mulwray mansion, Gittes finds Evelyn gone and the servants packing up the house. In the saltwater garden pond,  he spots a pair of eyeglasses.
Gittes confronts Evelyn about Katherine, whom she claims is her daughter, then breaks down after Gittes hits her and throws her down, and reveals that Katherine is "her sister and her daughter‚Äù. Cross had raped Evelyn when she was 15, causing her to become pregnant. The eyeglasses are not Hollis' as he did not wear bifocals.
Gittes arranges for the women to flee to Mexico and instructs Evelyn to meet him at her butler's home in Chinatown. He summons Cross to the Mulwray residence to settle their deal. Cross plans to incorporate the Northwest Valley into the City of Los Angeles, then irrigate and develop it. The bifocals are Cross', and Gittes accuses him of murdering Hollis.
Gittes is forced to drive Cross and Mulvihill to Chinatown, where Evelyn awaits. The police are there and detain Gittes. Cross advances on Katherine as she gets into Evelyn's car, identifies himself as her grandfather, and attempts to take her away. Desperate to escape her abusive father, Evelyn shoots him in the arm. However, the police open fire on Evelyn as she drives away with Katherine, killing her. Cross clutches a screaming Katherine and leads her away, while Escobar orders Gittes released. As he is led away by his associates, one of them urges "Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown."
