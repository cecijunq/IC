One Hour with You is a 1932 American pre-Code musical comedy film about a married couple who are attracted to other people. It was produced and directed by Ernst Lubitsch "with the assistance of" George Cukor, and written by Samson Raphaelson from the play Only a Dream by Lothar Schmidt. It stars Maurice Chevalier, Jeanette MacDonald, Genevieve Tobin, Charlie Ruggles and Roland Young. A French-language version titled Une heure pr√®s de toi was produced simultaneously, with Lili Damita playing Tobin's role.
The film is a musical remake of The Marriage Circle (1924), the second film that Lubitsch directed in the United States. One Hour with You was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.
The film was preserved by the UCLA Film and Television Archive with its original color tints restored.

== Production ==
Lubitsch was originally scheduled to direct One Hour with You and supervised the project in preproduction, but was unable to direct because his previous film, The Man I Killed, went beyond schedule. George Cukor was instead assigned to direct. Within two weeks after filming had begun, conflicts between Chevalier and Cukor brought Lubitsch back, although Cukor remained on the set. Cukor and Lubitsch each demanded sole credit for directing and the matter was litigated in court. Before a judgment was rendered, Cukor received a credit for assisting the direction and the right to break his contract with Paramount in order to direct What Price Hollywood? at RKO.
