== Plot ==
In 18th-century Russia, Tsar Paul is surrounded by murderous plots and trusts only Count Pahlen. Pahlen wishes to protect his friend, the mad king, but because of the horror of the king's acts, he feels that he must remove him from the throne. Stefan, who was whipped by the tsar for not having the correct number of buttons on his gaiters, joins with the count in the plot. The crown prince is horrified by their plans and warns his father, who, having no love for his son, places him under arrest for his foolish accusations. Pahlen uses his mistress, Countess Ostermann, to lure the tsar into the bedroom, where she tells him of the plot. The tsar summons Pahlen, who reassures him of his loyalty. Later that night, the count and Stefan enter his bedroom, and presently the tsar is dead. But moments later, Stefan turns a pistol on Pahlen. As the count lies dying on the floor, the countess appears and embraces Pahlen as he says, "I have been a bad friend and lover—but I have been a Patriot."
