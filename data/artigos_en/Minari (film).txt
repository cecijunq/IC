== Plot ==
In 1983, the Korean immigrant Yi family moves from California to a new plot of land in rural Arkansas, where father Jacob hopes to grow Korean produce to sell to vendors in Dallas. One of his first decisions is to decline the services of a water diviner; he digs a well in a spot he finds himself. He enlists the help of Paul, an eccentric local man and Korean War veteran. Jacob is optimistic about the life ahead, but his wife, Monica, is disappointed and worries about their son David's heart condition; he is frequently told not to run due to this. Jacob and Monica work sexing chicks at the nearby hatchery and argue constantly while David and his sister, Anne, eavesdrop.
To help watch the children during the day, they arrange for Monica's mother, Soon-ja, to travel from South Korea. Forced to share a room with her, David avoids her because she does not fit his idea of a grandmother. Still, Soon-ja attempts to adjust to life in Arkansas and bond with the children. The well Jacob dug runs dry. He is reluctant to pay for county water, but eventually is forced to do so. He runs into additional difficulties, such as the vendor in Dallas canceling their order at the last minute, but perseveres despite Monica's desire to return to California. This brings their marriage closer to a breaking point.
Meanwhile, Soon-ja takes David to plant minari seeds by the creek. She tells him how resilient and useful the plant is, and predicts plentiful growth. David finally begins to warm to her after she teaches him hwatu, bandages his wounds, and soothes him to sleep. Soon-ja also encourages him to do more physical activity, something his parents discourage, but she says he is stronger than they think. Soon-ja suddenly suffers a stroke overnight. She survives with medical treatment, but is left with impaired movement and speech.
Jacob, Monica, Anne, and David head to Oklahoma City for David's heart appointment and to meet a vendor for Jacob's produce. Although they learn that David's heart condition has dramatically improved and Jacob makes a deal to sell vegetables to a Korean grocer, Jacob also indirectly admits to Monica that his crops' success is more important to him than their family's stability. After an emotional argument, the two agree to separate.
During their absence, Soon-ja accidentally sets the barn containing the produce on fire. Upon arriving home, Jacob rushes in to save the crops, and Monica soon follows. But the fire grows out of control, and they decide to save each other, leaving the barn to burn. Distraught and confused, Soon-ja wanders off. Anne and David call for her to come back. Seeing that she is not responding to them, David breaks into a sprint to meet her, blocking her path. Soon-ja seems to recognize David for a moment and reaches for his hand. Her grandchildren lead her back home. The family is asleep on the floor, collapsed from fatigue. Soon-ja watches them sleep with a subdued expression.
Some time later, Jacob and Monica are with the water diviner, who finds a spot for a well. They mark it with a stone signifying their intention to stay on the farm. Jacob and David then head to the creek to harvest the minari, which has grown successfully, with Jacob noting how good a spot Soon-ja picked to plant it.

=== Development ===
Chung had initially hoped to make an adaptation of My Ántonia by Willa Cather but found out that Cather did not want film adaptations of her works to be made. He was inspired to make a film about his upbringing. Chung went to a library and wrote down some personal memories that he used as a basis for the story.Chung wrote the screenplay for Minari in 2018 shortly before taking on an instructor position at the Asia Campus of the University of Utah at Songdo, Incheon, South Korea. He drew from his childhood growing up on a farm in Arkansas. He cited Cather and Fyodor Dostoevsky as inspirations during the writing process, recalling the former's saying "that her life really began when she stopped admiring and started remembering" as a motivation to draw on his own experiences. In an interview with The Los Angeles Times, Chung spoke about the challenges of drawing on his family's experiences: "It was very difficult in the sense that I know that my parents are private people. And I didn't even tell them that I was making this film until I was in the editing room with it after I had shot it, because I was just so scared about what they would say."Chung wrote the script in English. Some dialogue was translated into colloquial Korean by Hong Yeo-ul, in consultation with Chung and the actors. Han and Youn assisted in the translation efforts.In early 2019, Christina Oh and Plan B Entertainment signed on as producers on the film. Oh later brought on A24 to distribute the film.


=== Casting ===
In July 2019, it was announced that Steven Yeun, Han Ye-ri, Youn Yuh-jung, Will Patton and Scott Haze had joined the film's cast.Han initially felt she could not participate because she needed to film Nokdu Flower, and suggested Chun Woo-hee as an alternate as she felt it was important that a Korean-born woman portray Monica. Han said that, of the main characters, Monica "seemed to be the most Korean" due to her difficulties with living in the U.S., and she felt it was important an actress born in South Korea, natively speaking Korean, take the role.


=== Filming ===
Principal photography began in July 2019 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Filming lasted 25 days. In order to make a deadline for Sundance, editor Harry Yoon edited the film as production took place.During filming Han and Youn Yuh-jung lived in the same Airbnb. As Youn was unknown in the U.S., unlike in South Korea, where she was a celebrity and given a lot of deference, she felt she needed to show her acting skills to a new audience.Youn previously lived in the U.S. and drew on that experience in her performance. Chung told her not to play Soon-ja like Chung's grandmother, a direction Youn welcomed. Chung also took Youn's suggestions, including one where her character takes back money her daughter had just put into a church collection plate, even though Chung's religious background made him hesitant about that idea. According to Youn, Chung intended for Soon-ja to be alive at the end of the story. Han used her own mother's life as inspiration for her portrayal of Monica.

=== Critical response ===

On Rotten Tomatoes, 98% of 318 reviews were positive, with an average rating of 8.7/10. The site's critics consensus reads: "Led by arresting performances from Steven Yeun and Yeri Han, Minari offers an intimate and heart-wrenching portrait of family and assimilation in 1980s America." Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score 89 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, writing: "Minari is modest, specific and thrifty, like the lives it surveys. There's nothing small about it, though, because it operates at the true scale of life." Nicholas Barber at the BBC rated the film 5/5, writing, "Sensitively written and acted, beautifully shot, and with a charming, sparingly used score, Minari is so engaging that it's easy to forget how radical it is." Reviewing the film for the Associated Press, Lindsey Bahr gave the film 4/4 stars, reporting, "One of the great triumphs of Minari is its presentation of authentic childhood. These kids are not saints or stand-ins or mouthpieces. They are their own persons."Robbie Collin of The Telegraph rated the film 4/5, writing, "Lee Isaac Chung's tender story is a finely-observed portrait of family relations and rural American values". Benjamin Lee at The Guardian also rated the film 4/5, writing, "The autobiographical story of a Korean American family trying to sustain a farm in rural Arkansas has deservedly become the festival's most universally loved film".Minari appeared on 68 critics' year-end top-10 lists, including first place on five year-end lists and second place on nine. In 2021, Forbes included it on its list of "The Top 150 Greatest Films of the 21st Century." In 2023, it ranked 9th on Collider's list of "The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far," saying that "Chung shows that the strongest families are defined by the hardship they overcame" and does so without "sensationalizing the story." Marie Claire also included it on its list of "The 100 Best Movies of All Time."


=== Accolades ===

Minari premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival where it received the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize and the U.S. Dramatic Audience Award. It was named one of the ten best films of 2020 by the American Film Institute and the National Board of Review, and received six Academy Award nominations. It also received three Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, 10 Critics' Choice Movie Awards nominations, and six Independent Spirit Award nominations.
At the 78th Golden Globe Awards (given by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association), the film won the Best Foreign Language Film. The determination that the film would be eligible for this category rather than Best Motion Picture – Drama, based on the Globes' rule that any film with over 50% of its dialogue not in English would be considered a Foreign Language Film, invited controversy. Lulu Wang, whose film The Farewell was subject to the same rule the previous year, wrote: "I have not seen a more American film than #Minari this year. It's a story about an immigrant family, IN America, pursuing the American dream. We really need to change these antiquated rules that characterize American as only English-speaking." Author Viet Thanh Nguyen wrote that the "decision speaks powerfully to the issue of what makes something—a language or a person or a culture—foreign." Many other filmmakers, actors, and authors, including Daniel Dae Kim, Simu Liu, Harry Shum Jr., Franklin Leonard, Phil Lord, Nia DaCosta, Celeste Ng, Min Jin Lee, and Phillipa Soo criticized the decision on similar grounds.
